# FNT — Bitmap Fonts (`.fnt`)

## Overview

`.fnt` files in `fonts/` are Total Annihilation's bitmap fonts, used by the
GUI system for all menu and in-game text. A GUI font gadget selects one by
basename (`filename=SMLFONT;` → `fonts/SMLFONT.FNT`, see [gui.md](gui.md)).

The format is a tiny fixed-height, variable-width, 1-bit-per-pixel glyph
atlas for up to 256 character codes. Glyph bits select "on" pixels; color
comes from the GUI layer, not the font.

No public format note for TA `.fnt` survives in our source set — the layout
below was reverse-engineered directly from the retail files and verified by
rendering glyphs (they produce correct letterforms).

## Format at a glance

```
+------------------------------+ 0x00
| u8  height   (pixel rows)    |
| u8  unused   (= 0)           |
| i8  y_offset (1..3 in retail)|  glyph rows start at penY - y_offset
| u8  first_code (= 0)         |  offset table is indexed by code - first_code
+------------------------------+ 0x04
| u16 glyph_offset[256 - first]|  file offset per character code; 0 = none
+------------------------------+ 0x204 (when first_code = 0)
| glyph records:               |
|   u8 advance                 |
|   ceil(advance*height/8) B   |  1bpp bitmap, row-major, MSB first
+------------------------------+
```

## Reference

### Header

| Offset | Size | Type | Description |
| ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| 0x00 | 1 | u8 | glyph height in pixels (all glyphs share it) |
| 0x01 | 1 | u8 | not read by the traced retail font consumers; 0 in every surveyed retail font |
| 0x02 | 1 | i8 | **vertical offset**: the executable places the glyph's first row at `penY − y_offset` (it reads the byte as signed). 1–3 across the retail fonts (height ≤ 12 → mostly 1; height 13–17 → 2 or 3) |
| 0x03 | 1 | u8 | **first character code**: the offset table is indexed by `code − first_code`; 0 in every retail font |
| 0x04 | 2 × (256 − first_code) | u16[] | absolute file offset of each character's glyph record, indexed by `code − first_code`; `0` = character not present. The executable applies no upper bound to the index, so a font must carry an entry for every code from `first_code` to 255 |

The header is four *single* bytes, not the two 16-bit words (`u16 height` at
0x00, `u16 unknown` at 0x02) that older community notes describe: the
font consumers read the height from byte 0 alone, skip byte 1, read byte
2 as the signed vertical offset the rasterizer subtracts from the pen Y, and
read byte 3 as the first character code that biases the offset table. The
u16 reading appears to work only because bytes 1 and 3 are zero in every
retail font. See [03 §7.1] (`R-FONT-01 §1`, `§4`) for the rasterizer
contract.

**Established (layout consequence):** a nonzero glyph-record start is
addressable only at offsets 1 through 65,535. This does not impose a 64 KiB
file-size limit: a bitmap can extend beyond its starting offset, and trailing
bytes need not be referenced. Retail fonts are a few KiB. The winning
`fonts/SMLFONT.FNT` in a patched install is the `rev31.gp3` copy — the same
bytes also ship in `ccdata.ccx` and `btdata.ccx` — at 2713 bytes, height 11,
offset 1, 223 glyphs present covering 0x20 through the Windows-1252 high
range. `totala1.hpi` carries its own copy of that logical path at 2704 bytes
with 222 glyphs: it lacks 0xA0, which the patch copy inserts. Neither copy
carries 0xFF, so both run 0x20 through 0xFE. Most retail fonts carry only the
94 printable ASCII glyphs.

### Glyph record

| Offset | Size | Description |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| +0 | 1 | u8 glyph advance in pixels — the pen moves by exactly this amount and the bitmap is exactly this wide; there is no separate bearing or spacing |
| +1 | ceil(advance × height / 8) | bitmap: `advance × height` bits, row-major top-to-bottom, left-to-right, most-significant bit first, packed continuously across rows (rows are **not** byte-aligned) |

Real example — from `fonts/SMLFONT.FNT` (both copies agree here: `A` and the
space glyph precede the point where the two diverge), header
`0B 00 01 00` (height 11), the offset table entry for `A` (code 65) is
`0x0340` (832). The record there is width 8 followed by 11 bytes, which
decode to:

```
........
........
...#....
..#.#...
..#.#...
.#...#..
.#####..
.#...#..
#.....#.
........
........
```

The space glyph (code 32, offset 524) is width 7 with an all-zero bitmap —
spacing is encoded as ordinary blank glyphs; there is no separate metrics
table, kerning, or baseline data beyond the header's vertical offset.

## Nanolathe parser policy

**Established (implementation):** `formats.LoadFNT` preserves the four
header bytes separately, indexes the shortened table from `first_code`, and
copies each referenced packed bitmap. It rejects zero height, a short header
or table, and any out-of-file glyph record or bitmap. These bounds are host
safety checks; retail uses the file in place without validation. Codes below
`first_code` and zero table entries remain absent. Authored fixtures in
`formats/fnt_test.go` exercise continuous cross-row packing, missing glyphs,
a nonzero first code and a negative vertical offset.

## Unknowns and caveats

- **Established (traced consumers):** byte 0x01 is not read by the height
  accessors, text-width walker, string drawer or glyph rasterizer
  [03 R-FONT-01 §1]. **Unknown:** its authored meaning, if any. Decider: a
  font-authoring tool of the period. This is an authoring-history gap, not
  a missing input to these runtime consumers; the parser preserves the byte.
- **No validation at all.** The file is read whole
  and used in place; a missing or zero-length font is fatal (path as the
  message) for the two startup fonts and every side font; a truncated font's
  offsets point past the block and the rasterizer reads what follows
  (`[02 R-MALF-01 §9]`, `[03 R-FONT-01 §1]`).
- Rendering (no inter-character spacing beyond the advance, no line
  spacing in the FNT path, colour selection, the caller-drawn shadows seen
  in-game) is engine behaviour, specified in [03 §7.1] (`R-FONT-01`), not
  stored in the font.
- Interpretation of codes ≥ 0x80 follows Windows-1252 in retail data
  (matching the localized strings in TDF files), but the font itself just
  maps byte values and the engine applies no code page.

- Layout reverse-engineered and render-verified against
  `fonts/SMLFONT.FNT`, then validated arithmetically against an earlier 24-font
  survey (this repository, 2026). [03 R-FONT-01 §1] records a later survey
  of 25 unique fonts; these are bounded corpus observations, not a fixed
  format-level font count.
- A fresh per-archive census of `totala1.hpi`, `rev31.gp3`, `ccdata.ccx` and
  `btdata.ccx` finds 39 font copies (24, 5, 5 and 5), representing 25 distinct
  logical paths and 21 distinct file-content hashes. Byte 0x01 is zero in
  every copy. Counts distinguish archive copies, names and content rather
  than assuming those populations coincide.
